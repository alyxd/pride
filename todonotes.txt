to do:
----
Fix gui bug(s)
improve auto-documentation (pride.components.package)
add api file + start using versionhelper
    - separate gui into separate package due to different levels of stability
change user.encrypt to use a per-cryptogram key to avoid dealing with nonces
deal with certificates properly?

changes
-----
partial re-work of base save/load
added show_status and hide_status on Window_Objects
added Popup_Notification for fade-out notifications
changed some items that were buttons to be containers if they are not interactive

notes
----
RPC acted weird on first run, then worked fine?


known issues
-----
encryptedstorage does not have OS provided encryption on linux
    - there is no equivalent on linux
    - just switch providers if using linux
