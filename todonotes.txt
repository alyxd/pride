to do:
----
Change git push to use a default site_config rather than the one for this machine
investigate Cython and make a JIT metaclass
Fix gui bug(s)

changes
-----
changed Base.delete_children method to not make a copy of the children list
fixed old-style shell startup_definitions defaults in site_config
fixed a bug when parsing --site_config entries
removed traceback from exiting via ctrl-c
removed debug alert statement from RPC module

notes
----
RPC "bypass_network_stack" is still present?
RPC acted weird on first run, then worked fine?
