to do:
----
Fix gui bug(s)
improve auto-documentation (pride.components.package)
add api file + start using versionhelper
    - separate gui into separate package due to different levels of stability
change user.encrypt to use a per-cryptogram key to avoid dealing with nonces
deal with certificates properly?

changes
-----
added ability to use floating point/percentages to h_range/w_range
added slider widget
small adjustment to base.Wrapper init that doesn't appear to be to negatively change functionality
added _theme_users and update_theme_users to gui.gui.Theme

notes
----
RPC acted weird on first run, then worked fine?


known issues
-----
encryptedstorage does not have OS provided encryption on linux
    - there is no equivalent on linux
    - just switch providers if using linux
