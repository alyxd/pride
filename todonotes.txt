to do:
----
Fix gui bug(s)
improve auto-documentation (pride.components.package)
add api file + start using versionhelper
    - separate gui into separate package due to different levels of stability
change user.encrypt to use a per-cryptogram key to avoid dealing with nonces
use a random salt in user2.User.derive_master_keys
deal with certificates properly?

ideas
-----

post-initializer inheritance
append each post-initializer into a list
call them all in succession

add_to method that adds a Base object to a list
#self.append_to(list)
#   keeps a handle on list
#   on delete, removes `self` from list



changes

notes
----
RPC acted weird on first run, then worked fine?


known issues
-----
encryptedstorage does not have OS provided encryption on linux
    - there is no equivalent on linux
    - just switch providers if using linux
